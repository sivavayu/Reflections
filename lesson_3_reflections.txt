When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the projects are large and there are multiple collaborators. I would want to keep only the files I need.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may not want all the files in the remote repository for my contribution to the project. I can manually pull the branch I need and stay up to date with that portion of remote repository. Also, remote repository is stagnant if no user pushes anything into it. If I am making changes to my local repository and Git auomatically tries to stay upto date with the remote repository, then it will be a chaos.
