When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the projects are large and there are multiple collaborators. I would want to keep only the files I need.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may not want all the files in the remote repository for my contribution to the project. I can manually pull the branch I need and stay up to date with that portion of remote repository. Also, remote repository is stagnant if no user pushes anything into it. If I am making changes to my local repository and Git auomatically tries to stay upto date with the remote repository, then it will be a chaos. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to "copy" the repositories from other user's profile to your profile when you don't have permission to change the files of the owner. 
	
	Clones are used to "copy" a remote repository on to the local drive. Remote repository may be on github on the internet or on a local computer of a friend or colleauge. 
	
	Branches are different contexts within the same repository. They have several uses like new feature, experimental feature, etc.
	
	I would use forks when I find a very useful project on GitHub and customize it fit my own purpose. I will use clones if I do not need a remote repository of my own until I am ready. And branches could be used for new features as mentioned in one of the interviews. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
